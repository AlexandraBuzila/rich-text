<p>Mutley, you snickering, floppy eared hound.</p>
<p>>When courage is needed, you're never around.</p>
<p>Those medals you wear on your moth-eaten chest should be there for bungling at which you are best.</p>
<p>So, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon.</p>
